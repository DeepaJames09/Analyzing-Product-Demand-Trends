# Analyzing-Product-Demand-Trends

This study investigates the optimization of supply chain management through improved inventory management and demand forecasting. Employing machine learning techniques (ARIMA, Exponential Smoothing) and analyzing historical data, we demonstrate the efficacy of Simple Exponential Smoothing for demand prediction, with the aim of enhancing strategic decision-making in supply chain operations.
